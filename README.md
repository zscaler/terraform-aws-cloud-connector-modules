# Zscaler Cloud Connector AWS Terraform Modules

## Description
This repository contains various modules and deployment configurations that can be used to deploy Zscaler Cloud Connector appliances to securely connect Workload to Internet and Workload to Workload communication within Amazon Web Services (AWS). The examples directory contains complete automation scripts for both greenfield/POV and brownfield/production use.

These deployment templates are intended to be fully functional and self service for both greenfield/pov as well as production use. All modules may also be utilized as design recommendation based on Zscaler's Official [Zero Trust Security for AWS Workloads Reference Architecture](https://help.zscaler.com/cloud-connector/zero-trust-security-aws-workloads-zscaler-cloud-connector).

## Prerequisites

Our Deployment scripts are leveraging Terraform v1.1.9 that includes full binary and provider support for MacOS M1 chips, but any Terraform version 0.13.7 should be generally supported.

- provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws v4.7.x
- provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/random v3.3.x
- provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/local v2.2.x
- provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/null v3.1.x
- provider registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tls v3.4.x

### AWS requirements
1. A valid AWS account
2. AWS ACCESS KEY ID
3. AWS SECRET ACCESS KEY
4. AWS Region (E.g. us-west-2)
5. Subscribe and accept terms of using Amazon Linux 2 (for base deployments with workloads + bastion) at [this link](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-zc4x2k7vt6rpu)
6. Subscribe and accept terms of using Zscaler Cloud Connector image at [this link](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-cvzx4oiv7oljm)

### Zscaler requirements
7. A valid Zscaler Cloud Connector provisioning URL generated from the Cloud Connector Portal
8. Zscaler Cloud Connector Credentials (api key, username, password) are stored in AWS Secrets Manager

See: [Zscaler Cloud Cloud Connector AWS Deployment Guide](https://help.zscaler.com/cloud-connector/deploying-cloud-connector-amazon-web-services) for additional prerequisite provisioning steps.

## How to deploy
Provisioning templates are available for customer use/reference to successfully deploy fully operational Cloud Connector appliances once the prerequisites have been completed. Please follow the instructions located in [examples](examples/README.md).

## Format

This repository follows the [Hashicorp Standard Modules Structure](https://www.terraform.io/registry/modules/publish):

* `modules` - All module resources utilized by and customized specifically for Cloud Connector deployments. The intent is these modules are resusable and functional for any deployment type referencing for both production or lab/testing purposes.
* `examples` - Zscaler provides fully functional deployment templates utilizing a combination of some or all of the modules published. These can utilized in there entirety or as reference templates for more advanced customers or custom deployments. For novice Terraform users, we also provide a bash script (zsec) that can be run from any Linux/Mac OS or CSP Cloud Shell that walks through all provisioning requirements as well as downloading/running an isolated teraform process. This allows Cloud Connector deployments from any supported client without having to even have Terraform installed or know how the language/syntax for running it.

## Versioning

These modules follow recommended release tagging in [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release,
along with the changelog, on the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/zscaler/terraform-aws-cloud-connector-modules/releases) page.
