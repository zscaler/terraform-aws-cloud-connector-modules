# Zscaler Cloud Connector AWS Terraform Modules

Description:
This repository contains various modules and deployment configurations that can be used to deploy Zscaler Cloud Connector appliances to securely connect Workload to Internet and Workload to Workload communication within Amazon Web Services (AWS). The examples directory contains complete automation scripts for both greenfield/POV and brownfield/production use.


## Prerequisites (You will be prompted for AWS keys and region during deployment)

These 

Terraform v0.14.0

provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws v4.7.x
provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/random v2.2.x
provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/local v2.2.x
provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/null v3.1.x

1. A valid AWS account
2. AWS ACCESS KEY ID
3. AWS SECRET ACCESS KEY
4. AWS Region (E.g. us-west-2)
5. Subscribe and accept terms of using CentOS 7 (for base deployments with workloads + bastion) at [this link](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00O7WM7QW/).
6. Subscribe and accept terms of using Zscaler Cloud Connector image at [this link](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-cvzx4oiv7oljm).
7. A valid Zscaler Cloud Connector provisioning URL
8. Zscaler Cloud Connector Credentials are stored in AWS Secrets Manager

## Deploying the cluster
(The automated tool can run only from MacOS and Linux)   
 
**1. Greenfield Deployments**

(Use this if you are building an entire cluster from ground up.
 Particularly useful for a Customer Demo/PoC or dev-test environment)

```
bash
cd aws/deployment/terraform
Edit the terraform.tfvars file under azure/deployment/terraform to setup your Cloud Connector(Details are documented inside the file)
./zsec up
```
**Greenfield Deployment Types:**

```
Deployment Type: (base | base_1cc | base_1cc_zpa | base_2cc | base_2cc_zpa | base_cc_gwlb | base_cc_gwlb_zpa | cc):
base: Creates 1 new VPC with 1 public subnet and 1 private/workload subnet; 1 IGW; 1 NAT Gateway; 1 Centos server workload in the private subnet routing to NAT Gateway;
1 Bastion Host in the public subnet assigned an Elastic IP and routing to the IGW; generates local key pair .pem file for ssh access
base_1cc: Base Deployment Type + Creates 1 Cloud Connector private subnet; 1 Cloud Connector VM routing to NAT Gateway; workload private subnet route repointed to service ENI of Cloud Connector
base_1cc_zpa: Everything from base_1cc Deployment Type + Creates 2 Route 53 subnets routing to service ENI of Cloud Connector; Route 53 outbound resolver endpoint; Route 53 resolver rules for ZPA
base_2cc: Everything from base_1cc + Creates a second Cloud Connector in a new subnet/AZ w/ Lambda for HA failover of workload route tables
base_2cc_zpa: Everything from Base_2cc + Creates 2 Route 53 subnets routing to service ENI of Cloud Connector; Route 53 outbound resolver endpoint; Route 53 resolver rules for ZPA
base_cc_gwlb: Base Deployment Type + Creates 4 Cloud Connectors (2 per subnet/AZ) routing to NAT Gateway; Gateway Load Balancer auto registering service ips to target group with health checks; VPC Endpoint Service; 2 GWLB Endpoints (1 in each Cloud Connector subnet); workload private subnet routes repointed to the GWLBE in their same AZ
base_cc_gwlb_zpa: Everything from base_cc_gwlb_zpa + Creates 2 Route 53 subnets routing to service ENI of Cloud Connector; Route 53 outbound resolver endpoint; Route 53 resolver rules for ZPA
```

## Destroying the cluster
```
./zsec destroy
```

## Notes

1. For auto approval set environment variable **AUTO_APPROVE** or add `export AUTO_APPROVE=1`
2. For deployment type set environment variable **DTYPE** to the required deployment type or add `export DTYPE=base_1cc_zpa`
3. To override the Cloud Connector instance type from m5.large, edit `ccvm_instance_type` in terraform.tfvars
4. To provide new credentials or region, delete the autogenerated .zsecrc file in your current working directory and re-run zsec.

**2. Brownfield Deployment Types**

```
Deployment Type: (cc_custom | cc_gwlb_custom):
cc_custom: Creates 1 new VPC with 2 public subnets and 2 Cloud Connector private subnets; 1 IGW; 2 NAT Gateways; 2 Cloud Connector VMs (1 per subnet/AZ) routing to the NAT Gateway in their same AZ; generates local key pair .pem file for ssh access; Number of Cloud Connectors and subnets deployed, ability to use existing resources (VPC, subnets, IGW, NAT Gateways), and toggle ZPA/R53 and Lambda HA failover features; generates local key pair .pem file for ssh access
cc_gwlb_custom: All options from cc_custom + Creates Gateway Load Balancer auto registering service ips to target group with health checks; VPC Endpoint Service; 1 GWLB Endpoints per Cloud Connector subnet
The following Cloud Connector terraform modules are provided for a brownfield deployment
```

ls aws/deployment/terraform/tfdir/modules
terraform-zscc-aws
terraform-zsroute53-aws
terraform-zslambda-aws
terraform-zsgwlbendpoint-aws
terraform-zsgwlb-aws
```
