## This is only a sample terraform.tfvars file.
## Uncomment and change the below variables according to your specific environment

#####################################################################################################################
##### Variables are populated automically if terraform is ran via ZSEC bash script.   ##### 
##### Modifying the variables in this file will override any inputs from ZSEC         #####
#####################################################################################################################

#####################################################################################################################
##### Cloud Init Userdata Provisioning variables  #####
#####################################################################################################################

## 1. Zscaler Cloud Connector Provisioning URL E.g. connector.zscaler.net/api/v1/provUrl?name=aws_prov_url

#cc_vm_prov_url                             = "connector.zscaler.net/api/v1/provUrl?name=aws_prov_url"

## 2. AWS Secrets Manager Secret Name from Secrets Manager E.g ZS/CC/credentials

#secret_name                                =  "ZS/CC/credentials/aws_cc_secret_name"

## 3. Cloud Connector cloud init provisioning listener port. This is required for GWLB and Health Probe deployments. 
## Uncomment and set custom probe port to a single value of 80 or any number between 1024-65535. Default is 50000.

#http_probe_port                            = 50000


#####################################################################################################################
##### Custom variables. Only change if required for your environment  #####
#####################################################################################################################

## 4. The name string for all Cloud Connector resources created by Terraform for Tag/Name attributes. (Default: zscc)

#name_prefix                                = "zscc"

## 5. AWS region where Cloud Connector resources will be deployed. This environment variable is automatically populated if running ZSEC script
##    and thus will override any value set here. Only uncomment and set this value if you are deploying terraform standalone. (Default: us-west-2)

#aws_region                                 = "us-west-2"

## 6. Cloud Connector AWS EC2 Instance size selection. Uncomment ccvm_instance_type line with desired vm size to change.
##    (Default: m6i.large)

#ccvm_instance_type                         = "t3.medium"
#ccvm_instance_type                         = "m5n.large"

#ccvm_instance_type                         = "m6i.large"
#ccvm_instance_type                         = "c6i.large"
#ccvm_instance_type                         = "c6in.large"

## 7. The number of Cloud Connector Subnets to create in sequential availability zones. Available input range 1-3 (Default: 2)
##    **** NOTE - This value will be ignored if byo_vpc / byo_subnets

#az_count                                   = 2

## 8. The number of Auto Scaling Groups to create. By default, Terraform will create a single Auto Scaling Group containing multiple subnets/availability zones. 
##    Uncomment and set to true if you would rather create one Auto Scaling Group per subnet/availability zone (var.az_count).

#zonal_asg_enabled                          = true

## 9. The minimum number of Cloud Connectors to maintain in an Autoscaling group. (Default: 2)
##    Recommendation is to maintain HA/Zonal resliency so for example if az_count = 2 and cross_zone_lb_enabled is false the minimum number of CCs you would want for a
##    production deployment would be 4

#min_size                                   = 2

## 10. The maximum number of Cloud Connectors to maintain in an Autoscaling group. (Default: 4)
##    Value must be a number between 1 and 10

#max_size                                   = 4

## 11. The health check grace period specifies the minimum amount of time (in seconds) to keep a new instance in service before terminating it if it's found to be unhealthy. 
##     Otheriwse Default is 15 minutes. (Default: 900 seconds/15 minutes)

#health_check_grace_period                  = 900

## 12. Amount of time, in seconds, until a newly launched instance can contribute to the Amazon CloudWatch metrics. 
##     This delay lets an instance finish initializing before Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling aggregates instance metrics, resulting in more reliable usage data.
##     Default: 0 seconds

#instance_warmup                            = 0

## 13. Whether newly launched instances are automatically protected from termination by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when scaling in. 
##     Uncomment to disable. (Default: true)

## 14. Network Configuration:

##    IPv4 CIDR configured with VPC creation. All Subnet resources (Workload, Public, Cloud Connector, Route 53) will be created based off this prefix
##    /24 subnets are created assuming this cidr is a /16. If you require creating a VPC smaller than /16, you may need to explicitly define all other 
##     subnets via public_subnets, workload_subnets, cc_subnets, and route53_subnets variables

##    Note: This variable only applies if you let Terraform create a new VPC. Custom deployment with byo_vpc enabled will ignore this

#vpc_cidr                                   = "10.1.0.0/16"

##    Subnet space. (Minimum /28 required. Default is null). If you do not specify subnets, they will automatically be assigned based on the default cidrsubnet
##    creation within the VPC CIDR block. Uncomment and modify if byo_vpc is set to true but byo_subnets is left false meaning you want terraform to create 
##    NEW subnets in that existing VPC. OR if you choose to modify the vpc_cidr from the default /16 so a smaller CIDR, you may need to edit the below variables 
##    to accommodate that address space.

##    ***** Note *****
##    It does not matter how many subnets you specify here. this script will only create in order 1 or as many as defined in the az_count variable
##    Default/Minimum: 1 - Maximum: 3
##    Example: If you change vpc_cidr to "10.2.0.0/24", set below variables to cidrs that fit in that /24 like cc_subnets = ["10.2.0.0/27","10.2.0.32/27"] etc.

#public_subnets                             = ["10.x.y.z/24","10.x.y.z/24"]
#cc_subnets                                 = ["10.x.y.z/24","10.x.y.z/24"]
#route53_subnets                            = ["10.x.y.z/24","10.x.y.z/24"]

## 15. Tag attribute "Owner" assigned to all resoure creation. (Default: "zscc-admin")

#owner_tag                                  = "username@company.com"

## 16. By default, terraform will always query the AWS Marketplace for the latest Cloud Connector AMI available.
##     This variable is provided if a customer desires to override/retain an old ami for existing deployments rather than upgrading and forcing a launch template change."

##     Note: Customers should NOT be hard coding AMI IDs as Zscaler recommendation is to always be deploying/running the latest version.
##           Leave this variable commented out unless you are absolutely certain why/that you need to set it and only temporarily.
##
##           This variable is supplied as a list, but only a single/the first AMI in the list is used by the launch template.

#ami_id                                     = ["ami-123456789"]

## 17. By default, GWLB deployments are configured as zonal. Uncomment if you want to enable cross-zone load balancing

## 18. Gateway loadbalancing hashing algorithm. Default is 5-tuple (None).
##     Additional options include: 2-tuple (source_ip_dest_ip) and 3-tuple (source_ip_dest_ip_proto)
##     Uncomment below the configuration you want to use.

#flow_stickiness                            = "2-tuple"
#flow_stickiness                            = "3-tuple"
#flow_stickiness                            = "5-tuple"

## 19. Indicates how the GWLB handles existing flows when a target is deregistered or marked unhealthy. 
##     true means rebalance after deregistration. false means no_rebalance. (Default: true)
##     Uncomment to turn this feature off (not recommended)

#rebalance_enabled                          = false

## 20. By default, the VPC Endpoint Service is configured to auto accept any VPC Endpoint registration attempts from any principal in the current AWS Account.
##     Uncomment if you want to override this with more specific/restrictive principals. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/configure-endpoint-service.html#accept-reject-connection-requests"

#allowed_principals                         = [\"arn:aws:iam::1234567890:root\"]

## 21. If set to true, add a warm pool to the specified Auto Scaling group. See [warm_pool](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/autoscaling_group#warm_pool).

##     Uncomment and specify a desired maximum number of Cloud Connectors to maintain deployed in a warm pool. Default is null which means use whatever maximum is set at the ASG.

#warm_pool_max_group_prepared_capacity      = null

## 25. Specifies whether instances in the Auto Scaling group can be returned to the warm pool on scale in
##     Uncomment to disable. (Default: true)

#reuse_on_scale_in                          = false

## 26. Target value number for autoscaling policy CPU utilization target tracking. ie: trigger a scale in/out to keep average CPU Utliization percentage across all instances at/under this number
##     (Default: 80%)

#target_cpu_util_value                      = 80

## 27. Determine whether or not to create autoscaling group notifications. Default is false. If setting this value to true, terraform will also create a new sns topic and topic subscription in the same AWS account"

#sns_enabled                                = true

## 28. List of email addresses to input for sns topic subscriptions for autoscaling group notifications. Required if sns_enabled variable is true and byo_sns_topic false

#sns_email_list                             = ["john@corp.com","bob@corp.com"]

## 29. Determine whether or not to create an AWS SNS topic and topic subscription for email alerts. Setting this variable to true implies you should also set variable sns_enabled to true
##     Default: false

## 36. By default, if Terraform is creating SGs an outbound rule is configured enabling 
##     Zscaler remote support access. Without this firewall access, Zscaler Support may not be able to assist as
##     efficiently if troubleshooting is required. Uncomment if you do not want to enable this rule.
##
##     For recommended least privilege, the rule creation is restricted to TCP destination port 12002
##     to the Support Server IP that remotesupport.<zscaler_cloud>.net resolves to. ie: if you are on
##     zscalerthree, perform a lookup for remotesupport.zscalerthree.net and update the variable

##### ZPA/Route 53 specific variables #####
#####################################################################################################################

## 37. By default, ZPA dependent resources are not created. Uncomment if you want to enable ZPA configuration in your VPC
##     Enabling will create 1x dedicated subnet per Cloud Connector availability zones in the VPC with Route Tables pointing
##     default route to the local AZ GWLB Endpoint. Module will also create a resolver endpoint and rules per the domains

##     deployment types where Route53 subnets, Resolver Rules, and Outbound Endpoints are being created. Two example domains are populated to show the 
##     mapping structure and syntax. ZPA Module will read through each to create a resolver rule per domain_name entry. Ucomment domain_names variable and
##     add any additional appsegXX mappings as needed.

#domain_names = {
#  appseg1 = "app1.com"
#  appseg2 = "app2.com"

## 42. Provide your existing Cloud Connector private subnet IDs. Only uncomment and modify if you set byo_subnets to true.
##     Subnet IDs must be added as a list with order determining assocations for resources like aws_instance, NAT GW,
##     Route Tables, etc. Provide only one subnet per Availability Zone in a VPC
##
##     ##### This script will create Route Tables with default 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop to the corresponding NAT Gateways
##     ##### that are created or exists in the VPC Public Subnets. If you already have CC Subnets created, disassociate
##     ##### any route tables to them prior to deploying this script.
##
##     Example: byo_subnet_ids = ["subnet-05c32f4aa6bc02f8f","subnet-13b35f23y6uc36f3s"]

#byo_subnet_ids                             = ["subnet-id"]

## 43. By default, this script will create a new Internet Gateway resource in the VPC.
##     Uncomment if you want to utlize an IGW that already exists (true or false. Default: false)
##     Dependencies require in order to reference an existing IGW, the corresponding VPC must also already exist.

##     based on the byo_igw variable and associate with the public subnet(s)
##     Uncomment if you want to deploy Cloud Connectors routing to NAT Gateway(s)/Public Subnet(s) that already exist (true or false. Default: false)
##     
##     Setting byo_ngw to true means no additional Public Subnets, Route Tables, or Elastic IP resources will be created

##
##     ***** Note 1 *****
##     This script will create Route Tables with default 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop to the corresponding NAT Gateways
##     whether they are created or already exist in the VPC Public Subnets. If you already have CC Subnets created, do not associate
##     any route tables to them.
##
##     ***** Note 2 *****
##     CC Route Tables will loop through all available NAT Gateways whether created via az_count variable or defined
##     below with existing IDs. If bringing your own NAT Gateways with multiple subnets with a desire to maintain zonal
##     affinity ensure you enter the list of NAT GW IDs in order of 1. if creating CC subnets az_count will 
##     go in order az1, az2, etc. 2. if byo_subnet_ids, map this list NAT Gateway ID-1 to Subnet ID-1, etc.
