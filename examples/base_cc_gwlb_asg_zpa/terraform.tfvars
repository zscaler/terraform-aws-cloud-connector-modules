## This is only a sample terraform.tfvars file.
## Uncomment and change the below variables according to your specific environment

#####################################################################################################################
##### Variables are populated automically if terraform is ran via ZSEC bash script.   ##### 
##### Modifying the variables in this file will override any inputs from ZSEC         #####
#####################################################################################################################

#####################################################################################################################
##### Cloud Init Userdata Provisioning variables  #####
#####################################################################################################################

## 1. Zscaler Cloud Connector Provisioning URL E.g. connector.zscaler.net/api/v1/provUrl?name=aws_prov_url

#cc_vm_prov_url                             = "connector.zscaler.net/api/v1/provUrl?name=aws_prov_url"

## 2. AWS Secrets Manager Secret Name from Secrets Manager E.g ZS/CC/credentials

#secret_name                                =  "ZS/CC/credentials/aws_cc_secret_name"

## 3. Cloud Connector cloud init provisioning listener port. This is required for GWLB and Health Probe deployments. 
## Uncomment and set custom probe port to a single value of 80 or any number between 1024-65535. Default is 50000.

#http_probe_port                            = 50000


#####################################################################################################################
##### Custom variables. Only change if required for your environment  #####
#####################################################################################################################

## 4. The name string for all Cloud Connector resources created by Terraform for Tag/Name attributes. (Default: zscc)

#name_prefix                                = "zscc"

## 5. AWS region where Cloud Connector resources will be deployed. This environment variable is automatically populated if running ZSEC script
##    and thus will override any value set here. Only uncomment and set this value if you are deploying terraform standalone. (Default: us-west-2)

#aws_region                                 = "us-west-2"

## 6. Cloud Connector AWS EC2 Instance size selection. Uncomment ccvm_instance_type line with desired vm size to change.
##    (Default: m6i.large)

#ccvm_instance_type                         = "t3.medium"
#ccvm_instance_type                         = "t3a.medium"

#ccvm_instance_type                         = "c6in.large"

## 7. The number of Cloud Connector Subnets to create in sequential availability zones. Available input range 1-3 (Default: 2)
##    **** NOTE - This value will be ignored if byo_vpc / byo_subnets

#az_count                                   = 2

## 8. The number of Auto Scaling Groups to create. By default, Terraform will create one Auto Scaling Group per subnet/availability zone. 
##    Uncomment and set to false if you would rather create a single Auto Scaling Group containing multiple subnets/availability zones

#zonal_asg_enabled                          = false

## 9. The minimum number of Cloud Connectors to maintain in an Autoscaling group. (Default: 2)
##    Recommendation is to maintain HA/Zonal resliency so for example if az_count = 2 and cross_zone_lb_enabled is false the minimum number of CCs you would want for a
##    production deployment would be 4

#min_size                                   = 2

## 10. The maximum number of Cloud Connectors to maintain in an Autoscaling group. (Default: 4)

## 11. The health check grace period specifies the minimum amount of time (in seconds) to keep a new instance in service before terminating it if it's found to be unhealthy. 
##     Otheriwse Default is 15 minutes. (Default: 900 seconds/15 minutes)

#health_check_grace_period                  = 900

## 12. Amount of time, in seconds, until a newly launched instance can contribute to the Amazon CloudWatch metrics. 
##     This delay lets an instance finish initializing before Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling aggregates instance metrics, resulting in more reliable usage data.
##     Default: 0 seconds

#instance_warmup                            = 0

## 13. Whether newly launched instances are automatically protected from termination by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when scaling in. 
##     Uncomment to disable. (Default: true)

#protect_from_scale_in                      = false

## 14. IPv4 CIDR configured with VPC creation. Workload, Public, and Cloud Connector Subnets will be created based off this prefix
##    /24 subnets are created assuming this cidr is a /16. You may need to edit cidr_block values for subnet creations if
##    desired for smaller or larger subnets. (Default: "10.1.0.0/16")

#vpc_cidr                                   = "10.1.0.0/16"

## 15. Number of Workload VMs to be provisioned in the workload subnet. Only limitation is available IP space

#owner_tag                                  = "username@company.com"

## 17. By default, terraform will always query the AWS Marketplace for the latest Cloud Connector AMI available.
##     This variable is provided if a customer desires to override/retain an old ami for existing deployments rather than upgrading and forcing a launch template change."

##     Note: Customers should NOT be hard coding AMI IDs as Zscaler recommendation is to always be deploying/running the latest version.
##           Leave this variable commented out unless you are absolutely certain why/that you need to set it and only temporarily.
##
##           This variable is supplied as a list, but only a single/the first AMI in the list is used by the launch template.

## 19. Gateway loadbalancing hashing algorithm. Default is 5-tuple (None).
##     Additional options include: 2-tuple (source_ip_dest_ip) and 3-tuple (source_ip_dest_ip_proto)
##     Uncomment below the configuration you want to use.

#flow_stickiness                            = "2-tuple"
#flow_stickiness                            = "3-tuple"
#flow_stickiness                            = "5-tuple"

## 20. Indicates how the GWLB handles existing flows when a target is deregistered or marked unhealthy. 
##     true means rebalance after deregistration. false means no_rebalance. (Default: true)
##     Uncomment to turn this feature off (not recommended)

#rebalance_enabled                          = false

## 21. By default, the VPC Endpoint Service is configured to auto accept any VPC Endpoint registration attempts from any principal in the current AWS Account.

#target_cpu_util_value                      = 80

## 28. Determine whether or not to create autoscaling group notifications. Default is false. If setting this value to true, terraform will also create a new sns topic and topic subscription in the same AWS account"

#sns_enabled                                = true

## 29. List of email addresses to input for sns topic subscriptions for autoscaling group notifications. Required if sns_enabled variable is true and byo_sns_topic false

## 30. Determine whether or not to create an AWS SNS topic and topic subscription for email alerts. Setting this variable to true implies you should also set variable sns_enabled to true
##     Default: false

#byo_sns_topic                              = true

## 31. Existing SNS Topic friendly name to be used for autoscaling group notifications assignment

#byo_sns_topic_name                         = "topic-name"

## 32. SSH management access from the local VPC is enabled by default (true). Uncomment if you

##     traffic to only the ZIA/ZPA required HTTPS TCP/UDP ports.

#all_ports_egress_enabled                   = false

## 34. By default, terraform will configure Cloud Connector with EBS encryption enabled.
##     Uncomment if you want to disable ebs encryption.

#ebs_encryption_enabled                     = false

## 35. By default, EBS encryptions is set to null which uses the AWS default managed/master key.
##     Set as 'alias/<key-alias>' to use an existing customer KMS key"

##     Note: this variable is only enforced if ebs_encryption_enabled is set to true

#byo_kms_key_alias                          = "alias/<customer key alias name>"

## 36. By default, Terraform will create an IAM policy for Cloud Connector instance(s) per
##     the terraform-zscc-iam-aws module. Optional access can be enabled for CCs to
##     subscribe to and utilize cloud workload tagging feature. Uncomment to create the 
##     cc_tags_policy IAM Policy and attach it to the CC IAM Role

##cloud_tags_enabled                        = true

## 37. By default, if Terraform is creating SGs an outbound rule is configured enabling 
##     Zscaler remote support access. Without this firewall access, Zscaler Support may not be able to assist as
##     efficiently if troubleshooting is required. Uncomment if you do not want to enable this rule.
##
##     For recommended least privilege, the rule creation is restricted to TCP destination port 12002
##     to the Support Server IP that remotesupport.<zscaler_cloud>.net resolves to. ie: if you are on
##     zscalerthree, perform a lookup for remotesupport.zscalerthree.net and update the variable
##     zssupport_server if required below.

##     deployment types where Route53 subnets, Resolver Rules, and Outbound Endpoints are being created. Two example domains are populated to show the 
##     mapping structure and syntax. ZPA Module will read through each to create a resolver rule per domain_name entry. Ucomment domain_names variable and
##     add any additional appsegXX mappings as needed.

#domain_names = {
#  appseg1 = "app1.com"
#  appseg2 = "app2.com"
#}
