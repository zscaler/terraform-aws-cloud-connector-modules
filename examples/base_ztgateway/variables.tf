  By default, this module does a lookup for all regional availability zones marked as available.
  If creating new Zscaler private subnets, it then automatically loops through in order of the returned list based on the variable az_count.
  Providing each AWS Zone ID explicitly here will take precedence over var.az_count.

  Example: When deploying a greenfield ZT Gateway template in region us-east-1 and 2 AZs where you want to ensure that new subnets
  are created in use1-az1 and use1-az5, set this variable to:
  az_ids = ["use1-az1" "use1-az5"]

  Caution: This argument is not supported in all regions or partitions
